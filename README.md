It enables the importation of literature notes from Zotero, and use them not only as the knowledge base but also the references for your writing. Requiring the installation of [Better Bibtex for Zotero](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) and [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org).

The [dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) query in the gif above is as follows:

```sql
table without id 
authors[0] as FirstAuthor, journal, year, title, 
link(file.name, "Note") as Note,
elink(zotero,"Zotero") as Zotero,
elink(doi,"DOI") as DOI
from "Literatures" // set the folder name of the literature notes
sort file.ctime desc
limit 100
```

And the notes generated by the command is as follows:

> [!important]
> You have options to add literature notes automatically when the bibliography file is updated.
> 
> This means that you have to add items only to Zotero, and automatically add them to Obsidian.

### Using literature notes as the references and export to docx(requires pandoc).

command: `Pandoc Citeproc Execution (docx)`

![](./assets/画面収録%202025-03-25%2021.01.31.gif)

- Optionally, set csl file path or url in the properties named `csl`.
- CSL file is the file that defines the citation style of the journal.
- You can download or get url of the csl file from [here](https://www.zotero.org/styles).

1. Open the Zotero
2. Open the "Preferences"
3. Set "postscript" as you want

example:

```javascript
if (Translator.BetterCSLJSON) {
  csl.key = zotero.key;
  csl.pdf = zotero.attachments
    .filter(a => a.localPath && a.localPath.toLowerCase().endsWith('.pdf'))
    .map(a => a.localPath);
}
```

> [!tip]
> Item key is useful if you want to use Zotero API.

The following is the reference for the script.

[Scripting :: Better BibTeX for Zotero](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/scripting/index.html)

### Abstract Option

Insert the abstract section in the top of the note.
The comment tag below is used to identify the abstract section.

`<!-- START_ABSTRACT -->`

`<!-- END_ABSTRACT -->`

### Template Option

Insert the template content in the top of the note.
The comment tag below is used to identify the template section.

`<!-- START_TEMPLATE -->`

`<!-- END_TEMPLATE -->`

> [!note]
> This template is applied to all notes and the content is static. 
> Therefore, it is recommended to use [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) for setting dynamic templates.

## Link Formatting 

When executing the "Pandoc Citeproc Execution (docx)" command, the link format is temporarily converted to the format of the pandoc citeproc.

The plugin modifies the link format as follows:
- `[[@citation-key]]` → `[@citation-key]`
- `[[@citation-key|aliases]]` → `[@citation-key]` // aliases are allowed
- `[[@citation-key]][[@citation-key]]` → `[@citation-key;@citation-key]` // multiple citations are allowed
- `[[@citation-key]]   [[@citation-key]]` → `[@citation-key;@citation-key]` // spaces or line breaks can be inserted between links
- End of a sentence: `[[@citation-key]]` → end of a sentence `[@citation-key]`. // inserts links before `.` if there is nothing between them.
